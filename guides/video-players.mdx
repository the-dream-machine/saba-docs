Saba is compatible with the following macOS video players:

- [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/)
- [IINA](https://iina.io/)

## VLC

This video player works great out of the box. No extra configuration is necessary. ðŸŽ‰

## IINA

If you prefer a modern interface with extensive support for most media formats and a Picture-in-Picture mode, this is the video player for you.

To get the best experience while using this video player, you may need to change a few settings that are enabled by default.

### 1. Disable default window launch behavior

By default, IINA will open media in a new window. This means that everytime you change the channel, a new window will open on top of the window that's currently playing.

Having five different channels stacked on top of each other is not a great experience. You should consider disabling this behavior, here's how to do it:

1. Open the IINA player desktop application then open the settings panel from the menu bar. (Keyboard shortcut: `âŒ˜` + `,`)

2. In the settings page, head to **General** > **Behaviour** and disable the option:
   - [ ] Always open media in new window

That's it! IINA is ready to use ðŸŽ‰

### 2. Disable On Screen Display (Optional)

/>

This step is optional.<br/> Whenever you perform an action such as changing the volume or changing the channel, IINA will display a box in the upper-left corner showing the property that has been modified.
Some people may prefer a more minimal experience without this log of events showing up on the screen.

1. In the settings page (`âŒ˜` + `,`). Go to **UI** > **On Screen Display** and disable the option:
   - [ ] Enable OSD

After disabling this option, those messages won't show up anymore.
