## Questions and answers

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I get a free trial?">

  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Will it work in my country?">
  Yes. Saba works reliably worldwide.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do I need a Raycast Pro Plan?">
  No. Saba works perfectly on the free version of Raycast. You do not need the
  paid Raycast Pro plan to access any features.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does it work on Alfred too?">
  No. Saba is made exclusively for Raycast.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is there a version for Windows?">
  No. Saba is made for macOS and there are no plans to bring it to Windows right
  now.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I stream on my phone/tv?">
  Yes. Once you have access to Saba, you can export the channels and
  import them into a compatible app on `iOs`, `tvOs`, `androidTV` and `android`.

  here soon.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Are you going to track me?">
  No. Saba does not track your usage behavior or your watching preferences. No
  data-harvesting. No recommendation algorithms.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does it work with my VPN?">
  Yes. If you are wary of exposing your IP address while streaming, you can turn on your VPN and Saba will still stream smoothly.
  Depending on your VPN provider, you may experience a slower download speed than usual.
